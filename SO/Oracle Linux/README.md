The version of Oracle Linux that i got on my work is weird

The first strange behavior is that you cant install the system with the Default Kickstart that is provided by foreman;

The second strange behavior occurs when you finish the build with foreman and the first grub version is bugged as hell.

We have some custom configs on the Snippets and Kickstart templates to pass by this weird behaviors
